![Знімок екрана (55)](https://github.com/ViestaBa/dashboard-most-streamed-spotify-songs-2023/assets/145791658/caa1131f-b810-4e5d-b7aa-09f39b83501e)
## Idea 💡 
This Power BI dashboard is structured around several key tasks:
- Filtering songs by artist /track name /date of release
- Displaying streaming statistics: streams per track /streams per date of release /average number of streams /percentage streams difference between average and top-streamed songs
- Highlighting specific characteristics of top-streamed song: track name /artist(s) /# of artists /date of release and speech% / instrumental% /liveliness% /danceability% /energy%
- Displaying track cover of top-streamed song
- Visualizing average energy% and average number of released songs within given time frame

## Key points 🗝️
### data scraping with Python
``` python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_excel('spotify_dataset.xlsx')
df = df[['artist(s)_name']]
df['artist(s)_name'] = df['artist(s)_name'].str.lower()
df['artist(s)_name'] = df['artist(s)_name'].str.split(',')
df = df.explode('artist(s)_name')
df['artist(s)_name'] = df['artist(s)_name'].apply(lambda x: x.strip())
df.to_excel('connection.xlsx')
```

### ER diagram
- data - spotify dataset with trac covers URLs;
- track_artist - table for Artist slicer;
- data_measures - table with measures used in dashboard;
- Dates - table generated by BRAVO
